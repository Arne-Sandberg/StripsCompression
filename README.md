# StripsCompression

## Abstract

Academic project to illustrate the topologic compression (lossless) principle.
Instead of describe a mesh triangle by triangle, common sides are aggregated in strips.
Despite its naive implementation, compression rate could reach about 40% on simple meshes.

To illustrate those strips, a "toy web-interface" can vizualize this mesh-cutting, animating strips construction.
Strips animation uses WebGL, modules are written in javascript so you only require a browser to launch a demo !
